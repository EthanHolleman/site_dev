      <description>The redtail catfish Link to article
Recently my late night TV show of choice as been River Monsters with Jeremy Wade which surprisingly strikes the perfect balance of cheesy reality TV and wildly educational programming and so I have been googling the various types of freshwater fish that Jeremy encounters.
I am particularly fond of Phractocephalus hemioliopterus; the red tailed catfish.
