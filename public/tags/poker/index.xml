      <title>Casual virtual Poker with Zoom and PlayingCards.io</title>

      <description>Update I recently found a number of .io type websites devoted specifically to poker (not sure why didn&amp;rsquo;t think to search poker .io earlier) which get around the main issues of playing using playingcards.io.
I would highly, highly recommend using lipoker.io. It handles betting with shortcuts for bets based on pot or blind sizes, handles turns automatically and does not require a sign up.
For Poker, lipoker is supporior in every way to PlayingCards.io due to being designed for this specific game. If for some reason you would still like to use PlayingCards.io continue reading, otherwise stop and use lipoker.io.</description>
