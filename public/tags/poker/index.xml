      <title>Casual virtual Poker with Zoom and PlayingCards.io</title>

      <description>Recently a few of my friends and I wanted to do virtual Poker night. We where not interested in playing for cash and so I started looking around for an online platform to make it happen.
Pretty much everything that comes up with a cursory google search did not satisfy my basic requirements but eventually I came across PlayingCards.io which provided what I think is the best solution for free, causal quarantine poker nights.
Step 1 is to set up your &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; with PlayingCards. Use this link to start building a table. Later once you finish setting everything up you can share the link to the table and others will be able to join, see and manipulate the objects on the table.</description>
