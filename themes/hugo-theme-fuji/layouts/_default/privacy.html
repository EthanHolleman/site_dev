<p>
    This site uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about
    use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often
    users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other
    sites they used prior to coming to this site. I use the information I get from
    Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the
    IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your
    name or other identifying information. I do not combine the information
    collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable
    information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your
    web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this
    site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use
    and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this
    site is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a>
    and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to
    this site by disabling cookies on your browser.
