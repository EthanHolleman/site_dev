# ETH3D

Thanks for your interest in commissioning a 3D printed object. Here you
will find information stuff related to printing, currently available filaments
and some answers to frequently asked questions

Found this page without talking to me in person? Impressive. If you are local
to the Davis / Sacramento area and are interested in high quality 3D printing
feel free to reach out to me via email at `printed@ethanholleman.com`.

## Printing philosophy

I am excited by making functional objects that do real things for people.
Especially things that would have likely not been feasible without access to
3D printing resources. 

While 3D printed parts are never as strong as injection molded plastic 

## Available filaments

<style>

.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  padding: 0 4px;
}

/* Create two equal columns that sits next to each other */
.column {
  flex: 50%;
  padding: 0 4px;
}

.column img {
  margin-top: 8px;
  vertical-align: middle;
} 

</style>


## Filaments 

Bellow are filaments I currently have on hand. I do most of my printed with
FusionFilaments HTPLA which is a high strength, high temperature resistance
version of traditional PLA. If there is a color you are interested in printing
in that I do not currently have on hand just let me know and I can have it shipped
but will likely ask you pay a marginally increased printing cost.
