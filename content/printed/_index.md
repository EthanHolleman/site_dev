# ETH3D

Thanks for your interest in commissioning a 3D printed object. Here you
will find information stuff related to printing, currently available filaments
and some answers to frequently asked questions. If you are local
to the Davis / Sacramento area and are interested in high quality 3D printing
feel free to reach out to me via email at **printed@ethanholleman.com**
or through Discord @ **Hollebread#4185**.


## Estimates

Since each printed object is unique I cannot provide an estimated cost to print
your object without first looking at your model's files. Once you have your files
in hand (these can be `.stl`, `.3mf`, `.obj` or `.step` files) please email your files 
to **printed@ethanholleman.com**, or 
along with your choice of color for each part and any specific requests. 
I'll get back to you with an estimate most likely within 24 hours.

## General print settings

TLDR: 3D printed parts will never be as strong as injection molded plastic, 
if your part required extreme durability let me know so I can adjust print
settings to increase strength at the cost of using more filament. 

For functional parts my default settings are 25% gyroid pattern infill with
5 walls. I find that this produces parts strong enough to endure use as
furniture repair, Nerf blasters etc. If your part is more cosmetic or intended to
prototype a final design I am also happy to adjust these settings to 
reduce material use and therefore the price of your print. 
If you would like an even more detailed picture of the setting that will be used
to print your part I am happy to export my slicer profiles and send them to
you upon request.

## Available filaments

Below are filaments I currently have on hand. I do most of my printed with
FusionFilaments HTPLA which is a high strength, high temperature resistance
version of traditional PLA. If there is a color you are interested in printing
in that I do not currently have on hand just let me know and I can have it shipped
but will likely ask you pay a marginally increased printing cost.

## Previous work

Below are some examples of things I have built for others and myself (mostly
Nerf blasters).

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2149.jpg" width=100%>
      <p>Orien blaster's Lynx parts, An awesome spring powered Nerf blaster with
      notoriously difficult to acquire hardware. Printing these parts was maybe
      wishful thinking.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="column">
      <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2231.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>Lepus by JackRabbitNerf. A super compact electric Nerf blaster capable
      of firing around 20 darts per second. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2470.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>Left: The Gryphon by Flygonial, an electric, semi-auto, flywheel powered blaster that I
      made specifcally for use at the Davis Nerf Club since they require use of full length darts. Right: 
      SLAB by SillyButts. This is a super fun to use, lever action, spring powered half-length 
      dart blaster.</p>
    </div>
   <div class="column">
       <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2590.jpg" width=100%>
       <p>Foregrip for the Nerf Pathfinder which in my opinion improves both the aesthetics of the 
       blaster and makes priming smoother. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
          <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2347.jpg" width=100%>
      <p>A rail mounted megaXL dart holder that I designed from the ground up
      and printed. It allows you to easily carry and keep accessible 6 megaXL
      darts which can be launched like a rifle grenade using a specific attachment
      at the end of your barrel. </p>
    </div>
   <div class="column">
      <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2446.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>SBL by Gavin Fuzzy designs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2695.jpg" width=90%>
      <p>Another full length Gryphon blaster printed for a member of the Davis
      Nerf Club. I wired in a PWM that allows you to actually adjust the motor
      speed with a dial so the blaster can launch darts anywhere between 90
      and 130 FPS.</p>
    </div>
   <div class="column">
      <img style="border: 5px solid #555;" src="/printed/images/IMG_2472.jpg" width="80%">
      <p>Buffer tube adapter a member of the Davis Nerf club designed and I
      printed for them.</p>
    </div>
