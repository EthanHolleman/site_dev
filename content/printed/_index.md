# ETH3D


<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
    Thanks for your interest in commissioning a 3D printed object. Here you
    will find information stuff related to printing, currently available filaments
    and some answers to frequently asked questions
    Found this page without talking to me in person? Impressive. If you are local
    to the Davis / Sacramento area and are interested in high quality 3D printing
    feel free to reach out to me via email at printed@ethanholleman.com.

## Printing philosophy

I am excited by making functional objects that do real things for people.
Especially things that would have likely not been feasible without access to
3D printing resources. 

While 3D printed parts are never as strong as injection molded plastic.

If a print fails due to an quality control issue on my end I'll be happy
to re-print the part for you at no cost. 

### General print settings

For functional parts my default settings are 25% gyroid pattern infill with
5 walls. I find that this produces parts strong enough to endure use as
furniture repair, Nerf blasters etc. If your part is more cosmetic or intended to
prototype a final design I am also happy to adjust these settings to 
reduce material use and therefore the price of your print. 
If you would like an even more detailed picture of the setting that will be used
to print your part I am happy to export my slicer profiles and send them to
you upon request.

## Estimates

Since each printed object is unique I cannot provide an estimated cost to print
your object without first looking at your model's files. Once you have your files
in hand (these can be `.stl`, `.3mf`, `.obj` or `.step` files) please email your files to **printed@ethanholleman.com**, or message me via discord **Hollebread#4185** 
along with your choice of color for each part and any specific requests. 
I'll get back to you with an estimate most likely within 24 hours.

## Available filaments

<style>

.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  padding: 0 4px;
}

/* Create two equal columns that sits next to each other */
.column {
  flex: 50%;
  padding: 0 4px;
}

.column img {
  margin-top: 8px;
  vertical-align: middle;
} 

</style>

Below are filaments I currently have on hand. I do most of my printed with
FusionFilaments HTPLA which is a high strength, high temperature resistance
version of traditional PLA. If there is a color you are interested in printing
in that I do not currently have on hand just let me know and I can have it shipped
but will likely ask you pay a marginally increased printing cost.
