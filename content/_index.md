# About me

I am a Ph.D student in the Integrative Genetic and Genomics (IGG) graduate group of
the University of California, Davis and member of the 
[Chedin laboratory](https://chedinlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) where
I research the principles of R-loop biogensis. 

Before starting with IGG, I did work in Soybean genomics, X-ray crystallography,
and high-throughput macromolecule crystallization, the last of which I am still 
somewhat involved in.

Outside of research I enjoy learning about and building gadgets with micro-controllers
and [Raspberry Pi computers](https://github.com/EthanHolleman/fridge_master_2000), 
fishing at Lake Beryessa and [Putah Creek](/posts/putah_fishing/), biking
around Davis, and 
[playing poker]({{< ref "/tags/poker/" >}}).

# About this site

At this site you can find information about my current and past professional and
personal projects. I will do my best to keep things as up to date as possible but there
may be some lag time between this reality and the one you are experiencing. 

Below is a summary of what you can find at each main section of the site.

## Posts

Short blog-like entries on various topics I am interested in ranging from
[visualizing esoterically encoded Vietnam War data]({{< ref "vietnam_data.md" >}})
to my friends and I's [running poker night results]({{< ref "running_winnings.md" >}}).

## Projects

Long-from non-technical descriptions of past and present research mixed in with
similar accounts of more personal projects. Read these to get an idea of what
I have been working on in both academic and personal capacities. Currently the most
work in progress part of the site. Has kind of been neglected compared to the
posts section. One up with more coming hopefully soon.
