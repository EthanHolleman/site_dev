What do the drugs we take actually do, at the cellular level, to out bodies? This can be an extemely diffcult question to answer, and one that the FDA does not require drug companies to when seeking approval for a new medicine (https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0410-347). 

For now, this is probably for the best. As if mechanistic understanding was required for a drug to enter the market the 8% of drug trials that are approved would likely drop below 1%. 

But having this mechansistic understanding of drug action gives researchers much more power to identify alternative applications, 

Car analgy that kind of thing could work here
as well maybe. 

Before driving across the country from Chicago to Davis Californa I took my car in to get the AC fixed. I do not pretend to know anything about car maintence but am always interested in hearing about the work of specialists whatever their field may be. 


# Background

The Industrial Macromolecule Crystallography Association - Collaborative Access Team (IMCA-CAT) is located at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) facility of Argonne National Laboratories.

# My project

Over the course of the summer I worked with Dr. X and Dr. Y who were working to determine how three peptides (short chains of amino acids) that had been implicated in human immune response to the Ebola virus interact with VP30, an Ebola protein key to the viruses infective capacity. 

Something along those lines I think.

The first and main challenge of the project as growing diffraction quility crystals of the three
protein-peptide complexes. Dr. X and Y and previously attempted applying crystalization conditions to a similar interaction with no luck. 

High throughput crystallography.


Waiting for results to come back would get thousands of images at a time and looking for faster and more effiecnet was to organize the images that keept streaming in I started building what would eventually mutate into Polo, a GUI for high-throughput crystalography that you can read more about here.
