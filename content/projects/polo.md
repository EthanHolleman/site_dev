This was a project I worked on as part of the [BioXFEL](https://www.bioxfel.org/)
summer internship program. I worked with [Dr. Sarah Bowman](https://hwi.buffalo.edu/scientist-directory/sbowman/)
and other members of Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (HWI).

If you are short on time and don't want to read these entire post here are the

# So what is "high-throughput crystallography"?

Lets say you are a researcher, trying to develop a treatment for a novel virus
that is quickly spreading across the globe. You know that the binding between
the viruses outer spike protein and a receptor on the cells of lung tissue is
critical to the pathogens virulence. 

If you knew that spike protein looked like, at the atomic, level you could more
easily design a small-molecule drug that would interrupt its "normal" interaction
with the lung tissue receptor protein. Of course it is non-trivial to actually "look" at a protein. In fact, the wavelength of visible light is much larger than the atoms you are trying to peak at. 

To get around this problem a number of specialized techniques have been
developed, the most commonly employed being X-ray crystallography (although keep your eye on
emerging [cryo-EM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10368-w) technologies.)

Just like minerals in the Earth, proteins can form crystalize, organizing into
an infinitely repeating, regular pattern of molecules.

To grossly oversimplify, X-ray crystallography takes advantage of the small wavelength
of X-rays and the repeating structure of protein crystals to "amplify" the 
extremely small signal produced by a single molecule allowing researchers, along
with the help of a lot of fast-fourier transforms to piece together the 3D structure
of a protein with resolutions below 1.5 Ã… (angstroms). For more information
on X-ray crystallography check out IMCA-cat summer internship.

The only problem is that actually growing these protein crystals. Doing so can
be extremely difficult, labor intensive and comes with no guarantee of success.
In most cases this will involve researchers manually creating grids of
chemical conditions mixed with different concentrations of protein in the
hopes that one produces crystals. Additionally, these types of manual screens
require a large amount of extremely pure protein which is often difficult and
or expensive to obtain. 

High-throughput crystallography utilizes liquid handling robotics, automated 
microscopy, and nano-liter well sizes in order to do effectively the same process
while screening more chemical conditions and using less protein. This makes it
appealing for researchers working with many or difficult to crystalize proteins.

# More data more problems: Polo's motivation

The number of conditions that high-throughput approaches is at the same time
its selling point and greatest challenge. A single-sample screening run
can produce over 15360 images that have to been sorted though to determine
if any contain crystals. This is the worst king of monotonous task as it is
highly repetitive but yet required acute concentration, as missing a crystal
in one image could mean the difference between a successful and failed study.

title="Representation of the image data that would be created by a typical high-throughput screen of one protein sample at HWI. Each pixel represents one image a researcher would have to manually review.">}}

Fortunately, advances in machine learning have allowed for the development of
models that can do this work automatically and with reasonable accuracy. The
most recent iteration of this has been the MARCO (Machine Recognition of 
Crystallization Outcomes) model published by [Andrew Bruno *et al* in 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198883).

The MARCO model opened the door for experts to automatically classify
crystallization images, but lack of a graphical interface and data management
program made it largely inaccessibly to users without Python and or command
line experience. Therefore the goal of my project was to produce a free, easy to use
graphical interface for both HWI and non-HWI users that would integrate the MARCO
model with the best features of existing image review software.

# Outcome

Despite the short development timeline (largely 12 weeks over the summer) I would
say Polo was a success. Over that period of time I was able to release versions of the program for Linux, Mac and Windows, created a website to host the documentation ([which you
can view here](https://hauptman-woodward.github.io/Marco_Polo/)) and began drafting
a manuscript which is currently under review by the Journal of Applied Crystallography.

Here are a few images of some of the Polo interfaces, for full details, user-guides,
code documentation and video tutorials please visit the 
[Polo website](https://hauptman-woodward.github.io/Marco_Polo/).

The most recent version of Polo can be downloaded [from this link](https://github.com/Hauptman-Woodward/Marco_Polo/releases).
Beyond automatic image classification via MARCO, Polo includes a number of useful
tools and interfaces. HWI and non-HWI users alike can

- Download images directly from Polo using the integrated FTP client
- Export their results to PowerPoint presentations, csv or json files
- View images as slideshows or in arrays of up to 96 images
- Easily associate visible light microscopy images to alternative spectrums such as UV-TPEF and quickly swap between the two


Polo is also fully open source and free for academic and commercial use!

There are also a number of resources for getting starting with Polo, including
[video guides](https://hauptman-woodward.github.io/Marco_Polo/video_guides.html)
where I walk you through using Polo's main interfaces, 
[written tutorials](https://hauptman-woodward.github.io/Marco_Polo/user_guide.html)
and API style [code documentation](https://hauptman-woodward.github.io/Marco_Polo/polo.html)
for anyone interesting in extending or modifying Polo. 

# Future goals and collaboration

My personal goal for Polo was to create something that was accessible, easy to use and significantly reduced human work. If, after trying out the program or reviewing
any of the links above you have suggestion on how Polo can better fulfil those
goals please let me know! Feel free to reach out through GitHub, pull request,
or through the [Polo bug and suggestion Google form](https://hauptman-woodward.github.io/Marco_Polo/reports.html).

I still work to maintain Polo and do my best to respond to questions and fix
bugs reported by users. If any of the above is interesting to you or you have
questions about how Polo might be able to help you, your lab or organization
please reach out! I would love to talk. 

In the future I would like involve researchers from other high-throughout
facilities to extend the functionality and flexibility of Polo.
