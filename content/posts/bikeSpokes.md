I live and work in Davis California. Davis is notable for many things
but one of the most visible is the degree of bike specific infrastructure.
In terms of the quantity and quality that you might be forgiven for thinking
you are riding in a place like the Netherlands.

Accordingly, I bike pretty much everywhere within town which means locking
up my bike is a ritual I preform usually at least 2 times a day. Part
of that ritual is using my frame lock, shown in the image below.

This lock is integrated into the frame and works by passing between
the rear wheel spokes, preventing the bike from being rolled away
(although it does nothing to stop someone from throwing it in the
back of a pickup). Consequencly, when using this lock, just by
chance, the mechanism ends up bumping into one of the spokes forcing
my to manually move the wheel slightly to get the lock through
the wheel. It feels like this happens way more often than it
should intuituively considering the size of the wheel and the 
relatively small diameter of the spokes. 


So I wanted to test how often this really does happen and does the
reality match up with a calculated probibility of the lock bumbing
the spokes. Was this just a small example of loss aversion bias; i.e.
I would only remember the times when the lock hits the spokes because
locking a bike normally is relatively un-notable and boring (speaking
of which this whole article is about that, why are you reading this?).
