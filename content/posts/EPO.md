I have been interested in education since my undergraduate career. While working 
towards my undergrad degree in bioinformatics I designed and presented a
short series of lectures at a local assisted living facility focused on building 
proficiency with technology as a means of independence. The series 
covered the very basics of computer and internet usage; how to email a picture, 
write a letter with a word processor, and spot common signs of phishing scams. 
The hour sessions were in all honesty, slow, painful, and inexplicably seemed to 
elicit pseudo-existential questions from the participants like 
“Where does a window end and another begin?”, but ultimately were very rewarding. 
While this by no means constituted a full-fledged-credited-course I got a great 
crash course and reality check in what is involved in creating a small 
curriculum and how to stay flexible when it all falls apart in the middle. 

This type of experience got me more interested in how I could get involved in 
personal mentorship entering grad school and over the past year I 
participated in the [Sheldon High School Biotechnology mentoring program](https://blogs.egusd.net/explore/sheldon-high-school-academy-pathway-programs/), where I answered questions from 
and just generally got to know a student from Sheldon High in the program 
interested in bioinformatics and computer science. I now hope to take on 
similar, more official responsibilities and contribute to our graduate programs 
educational curriculum as the educational policy officer.

As the educational policy officer I would first like to build on the excellent 
foundation Shannon and others have laid through the 2021 GGG298 course. I would 
like to work with her as she transitions out of the position to review both 
what she and previous students enjoyed / thought could be improved about the
course and poll the incoming cohort to learn what new areas of focus might be 
of interest to incoming students.

A significant role of the education policy officer is to access internal 
fellowship applications from current and incoming IGG students. In this effort 
I would both work to make sure fellowship deadlines are well advertised 
throughout the IGG community and ensure any evaluations reflect criteria 
established by the IGG admissions committee and if administratively possible 
possible are publicly available to applicants.

Finally, as the educational policy officer I would focus on the accessibility 
of IGG courses as we transition back to an in-person model. I was stuck recently 
by this [New York Times Opinion piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fYpvhMgQ_4)
focusing on the challenges faced by many in “returning to normal”. A key 
sentiment being along the lines of “Why were we able to make the world virtually
accessible only when it mattered for fully-abled people". Remote learning offers huge 
advantages to many people and we would be remiss not to take this opportunity to 
improve what is accepted as normal using our experiences from the past year. 
With input from other IGG students and facility I hope to identify routes to 
increase the accessibility of our coursework by. 

Thank you for your consideration and please feel free to reach out to me 
with any questions.
