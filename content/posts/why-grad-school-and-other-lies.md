If you landed directly on this page and are not familar with myself I
am a second year Ph.D student at UC Davis studying computational and
molecular biology. But as is with all things it was not always this way. In March
2020, with the guitine blade of the pandamic just beining to enter sight but
already accelerated to lethel speeds
 I was not a lowly graduate student but a lowely undergrad senior

### Choose a PI not a project

Most important. Unless you entered grad school to study one specific topic
with a particular superstar PI in which case I bid you luck, the most important
choice you will make in your early graduate career is not *what* you will
research but *who* you will do that research with.

This may seem antitheical to everything you will hear in the pre-admissions
process which focuses in on your specific research interests and seeing
that they align with the program you are applying to and the investigators
which compose it. But in reality and at least in my experience at any large
enough insutution there will be so many people doing interesting work.

Once you are in a lab and have a main focus, one of the joys of grad school
is that you are the one that will drive that project forward. While a good
PI will provide you direction you will be the one actually at the
wheel pippetting solution A into solution B for this reason at this time. This
means you have a large part in shaping the direction of your project and therefore
can sculpt the rough edges to suit your interests.

Research questions are inherintely composed of a much softer, flexible and
forgiving material than PIs. PIs are mitheral. No matter what blade you
wield you will be un-able to cut their armour. You are stuck with the one you
choose for the rest of your graduate career. 

Your PI will not change.

So if the choice is cooler project or cooler PI there is no question.


## Add salt

My PI likes to say grad school is a marathon not a sprint. Using those units
I've gone only a few miles and trust me the analogy holds.
