UC Davis, I recognize your good intentions. You want to save electricity, reduce costs.
prevent waste. I understand this, and your attempts are nobel. 

However, with most things, even the most obvious, seemingly harmless solutions
should not be applied without second thought. 

Currently, I am sitting typing this in the dark in the "Quiet writing space" of the
newly and well renovated Walker Hall; the new hub for graduate and postdoc student
resources. As part of what I assume was a energy consious initiative on behalf
of administration motion detecting lights seem to have been installed in most
rooms that turn off after what seems to be about 10 minutes of not detecing
any movement.

Now I may have a radically different writing phisophy than others, but I generally.

So please, if you are a designer, or somehow are in the vast network of administration
that residues between the moment funds are allocated and when a light switch is installed,
or in fact any other peice of inferstructure that a human will regulary interact with please
take a moment to consider the context of that inferstructure.

You might just make another grad students queit writing time a bit brighter.
