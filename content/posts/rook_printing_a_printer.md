Over the past two months or so I have worked on-and-off on
what was a really interesting a fun build; a mostly 3D printed
3D printer called the Rook by
[Rolohaun](https://github.com/rolohaun/Rook). This is an
open source DIY printer with the goal of accessibility and low
cost.

This was my first DIY printer build and I would highly recommend
the Rook to anyone who has been thinking about or is interested
in DIY printers but is unsure they want to make a one to two 
thousand dollar investment in a DIY machine like the Voron
without first gaining some lower stakes experience. I also see the
Rook as a really great educational / demonstration piece due to
its portability (I was able to carry-on the fully assembled printer for my flight home from Chicago without issue) and low
power requirements. 

Completed and functional Rooks can apply for an official
serial number issued by the designer Rolohaun. Below is my
serial request video demonstrating that my Rook was functional.

machine including part sourcing, assembly and details on some
custom parts I designed for my machine you can read through
