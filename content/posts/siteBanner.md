The site banner image is actually a specific type of infill pattern used in 3D printing
called "gyroid infill".

Generally, to save time and plastic, parts that are 3D printed are not printed
as 100% solid blocks of plastic. Instead the user will set a infill percentage
that defines how much of the interior space is filled. Once that is decided you
still need to determine exactly how you are going to fill that space so it
can be translated into command the printer can understand.

Enter infill patterns.

These are strategies used to fill in the internal space of a printed object. One of
the most popular for high strengths prints is gyroid infill because it is equally
strong in all directions and optimizes material use.

I think the pattern it creates also looks very interesting.

I created these images by screenshoting a layer of a print I was setting up
using gyroid infill and then manipulating the image in InkScape to
create a high resolution bitmap.

Thanks for your curosity!
