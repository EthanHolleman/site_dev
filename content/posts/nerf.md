It is likely you have at some point come into contact with the Nerf brand at
some point in your life. Hasbro's iconic line of foam flinging mechanisms 
until recently held a near complete monopoly on the hobby. Nerf blasters something
under-powered. With some blasters including mechanisms to reduce the velocity
of darts fired. This association is so strong that in video games the intentional
reduction of a weapons effectivenss by the game's developers is often referred
to as "nerfing".

However there have always been a small continent of nerds who wanted to maintain
the goofy persona of Nerf as a hobby but push the limits of their blasters.
These early "hobby grade" Nerfers modified existing blasters and even constructed
completely origin designs using parts you could but from a hardware store.

### The advent of accessibly 3D printing

The nerf community grew slowly but within the last 4 years Nerf technology
(and I am using that phrase completely seriously) has exponentially accelerated
catalyzed by the recent accessibility of reasonably reliable low cost
3D printers. 

**My modified Ender 3V2 printer**

I have added parts (some printed on this machine) in an attempt to increase performance and reliability. The Ender3 is a common workhorse machine due to its low cost at the price of requiring continual tinkering in order to keep running consistently.">}}

This combined with freely available computer aided design (CAD) programs
like Fusion360 has allowed those interested in Nerf to design and produce a huge
array of parts, accessories and complete blasters. The degree to which 3D printing
has changed the hobby cannot be overstated. 

Unlike many hobbies where inovation is driven in a top down manor, with companies
producing new and more preformant designs, mechanisms and {something else} the
distributed nature of 3D printing and the lack of willingness from Hasbro to
produce high performance blasters has meant that innovation in hobby grade
Nerf has been driven and proliferated almost entirely from the bottom up with
individuals designing, experimenting with, and printing the next greatest blaster.

**Popular open source blasters**

Talon Claw, a shorter more compact version of the Caliburn also by CaptainSlug. The files for all of these blasters are freely" >}}

This has fostered an open-source spirit, with most designers making the files
for their blasters freely available so anyone with a 3D printer can utilize them.

Due to the extreme utilization of 3D printing has meant that participation
at the highest levels (ultrastock) usually requires the ability to understand
and operate a 3D printer, some degree of CAD skills, and the mechanical ability
to assemble blasters with minimal instructions. 

### Rise of Nerf competetors 

Dart Zone. Allows those who want to begin playing higher level nerf enter into
the hobby without having to commit to buying and learning how to operate a
3D printer.



### Ultrastock and nerf communties

Bay Area Ultra Stock ![](/posts/images/nerf/BAUS.jpeg)

Join BAUS Discord [at this link](https://discord.com/invite/bBy368s).

Almost all blasters at these events will be 3D printed foam flingers, often
completely printed, assembled and tweaked by their owners.



### Emergence of competitive dart tag competitive

### Competetive nerf as an entry point for young enginners and designers

Anyone with a few hundred dollars can design and produce their own completly
custom blaster. To do so required serious design skills, critical thinking,
and dedication to bring to reality. But there is serious payoff to
brining and using a well-built blaster to Nerf game with those who have put
just as much effort into their own collection. The open-source and welcoming
nature of the hobby grade Nerf community makes it excellent environment for
aspiring enginners to participate and build real, practical skills and
knowledge in a forgiving environment.
