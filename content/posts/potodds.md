I spent most of the day today learning about Javascript and CSS by building
a (very ameutur) website that you can use to test your Poker 
[pot odds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_odds) calculation skills.

Determining pot odds is useful as when compared to the probability of winning
a hand the call's [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)
can be approximated. 

You can visit the website at [potoddsquiz.com](http://potoddsquiz.com/) view the
the code at the [GitHub page](https://github.com/EthanHolleman/potoddsquiz.git)
or use the website embedded directly below.

This is the first Javascript project I have built from scratch and hosted somewhere
and was a great way to start learning more about the very basics of web development
and the Javascript language.
