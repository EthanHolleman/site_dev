# 3D objects

This page contains links to various 3D models I have created. 
Most of these are hosted on different sites for visibility /
accessbility reasons but this page serves as central link hub for
most of my models.

## Functional objects


### Medicine cabinet shelf bracket

[Link: hosted on Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/216433-medicine-cabinet-shelf-bracket)

This is a tiny push in bracket thing to hold up shelves
in some medicine cabinets (including mine). Even though
the model is extremely simple it is one of my favorite designs
because the story behind it ended up really representing the
power / coolness of 3D printing.

Basically, cat got into medicine cabinet knocked a bunch of
things around causing a shelf to fall out and one of the brackets holding it up
to be lost in the process. I quickly pulled out the calibers,
took some measurements of other brackets, fired up Fusion360,
cranked out a model and had it printed all within 25 minutes.
The best part was they fit the first time!

### Filament holder dowel bracket

This was one of the first objects I modeled. It uses a wooden dowel to hold
spools of filament. Keeps them out of the way in small workspaces and easily
accessible at the same time. Still using it to this day.

## Nerf / Dart tag related objects
