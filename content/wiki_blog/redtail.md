# The redtail catfish

[Link to article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redtail_catfish)

Recently my late night TV show of choice as been *River Monsters with Jeremy Wade* which surprisingly strikes the perfect balance of cheesy reality TV and wildly educational programming and so I have been googling the various types of freshwater fish that Jeremy encounters. 

I am particularly fond of *Phractocephalus hemioliopterus*; the red tailed catfish.

It is currently the only extant species of the *Phractocephalus* genus and is noted for its potential to grow to massive sizes (hence its River Monster's cameo) reaching up to 6 feet long and 180 pounds. 

Interestingly, despite their potential for growth the redtail catfish is popular with fish enthusiasts (?) and if they are able to reach full size will require a tank of at least 10,000 gallons.
