      <description>This past quarter I was the teaching assistant for the MCB-162; and upper division human genetics course here at UC Davis. This was my second time as a TA and overall enjoyed my role in the class. This class was about 60% the size of the previous class I TA&amp;rsquo;ed for which was nice in terms of reducing the amount of grading required and being able to spend more time with individual students during office hours.
Despite my best efforts attendance at office hours was still fairly low with 3-4 semi-regular students and sporadic attendance from the rest of the class.</description>
