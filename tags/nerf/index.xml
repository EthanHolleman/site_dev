      <description>A little while ago I was at Bay Area Ultra Stock&amp;rsquo;s 40th meetup and managed to record a few of the games. Played at Braly Elementary school in Sunnyvale California.
For these games I was playing with my Pump Skewer by SillyButts designs. All parts were printed on my modified Ender3V2.</description>

      <description>It is likely you have come into contact with the Nerf brand at some point in your life. Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s iconic line of foam flinging mechanisms, until recently, held a near complete monopoly on the hobby. While Nerf blasters remain fun for casual around-the-house or workplace battles, for many, they simply do not pack enough of a punch. There has always been a small continent of nerds who longed to maintain the goofy persona that Nerf affords with its bright colors, oversized projectiles, and exaggerated designs but push the limits of their blasters. These early &amp;ldquo;hobby grade&amp;rdquo; Nerfers modified existing blasters and even constructed completely original designs using parts you could buy from a hardware store.</description>
