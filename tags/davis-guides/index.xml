      <description>Update for Jammy Jellyfish users: May 2022 If you recently updated to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) you may have found yourself unable to connect to Eduroam. This seems to be due to a weird ssl issue with Eduroam that I do not currently pretend to understand but no one cares about that anyway. You want answers. Here is what worked for me which is based off of this bug report.
Open /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf in your favorite text editor. Add the following lines to the beginning of the file. openssl_conf = openssl_init [openssl_init] ssl_conf = ssl_sect [ssl_sect] system_default = system_default_sect [system_default_sect] Options = UnsafeLegacyRennegotiation Save and reboot.</description>
