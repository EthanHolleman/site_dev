      <description>A while ago when I was reading through my graduate group&amp;rsquo;s weekly bullitin I saw a solicitation for the Cornell Institute For Digital Agriculture (CIDA) Hackathon.
I had not participated in a Hackathon before and it looked interesting so I applied, was selected, and kind of forgot about it until last weekend when I needed to find and join a team. I ended up finding a great group of students from the Netherlands, Brazil and Ohio worked with them on our project proposal basically my entire waking Saturday.
Our group decided to focus on the food waste challenge category with out central idea being an app that would connect food waste medium scale food waste producers like restaurants to similar scaled consumers, such as farmers who utilize food wastes for composts or animal feed.</description>
